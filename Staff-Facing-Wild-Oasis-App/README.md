# Staff facing wild oasis app

This is the full-stack internal application used inside the hotel to manage bookings, cabins, guests, etc. This web app is completely built in React JS with the help of various third-party libraries. For routing react router, styling: styled components, remote state management: react query, UI state management: context API, form management: react hook form, etc. In order to store the data and perform backend operations, I used the Supabase platform, which provides backend services.
